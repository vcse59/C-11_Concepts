Member types
============
member type	               definition
------------------------------------------------------
value_type	      =>         The template parameter (T)
reference	      =>         const T&
const_reference	  =>         const T&
size_type	      =>         size_t
iterator	      =>         const T*
const_iterator	  =>         const T*
